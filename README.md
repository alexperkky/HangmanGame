This is a javascript based word-guessing game with a limit of 9 failed guesses and a number of different words to guess.
The game tracks how many times you have successfully guessed all the letters of a word, as well as how many times you lose the game.
The game also tracks which letters you have guessed unsuccessfully, as well as populates the correct letters in the blanks listed for the word.
My version has a food theme, so all of the words have to do with a food of one form or another.
When the game ends, win or lose, the incorrect guesses empty once you hit a new key to guess, as well as adding to the win or loss trackers, respectively.
